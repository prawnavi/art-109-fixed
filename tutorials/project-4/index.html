    <h1>A Day in My Life</h1>

    <p><strong>6:00 AM</strong></p>
    <p>“Alexa… what time is it?”</p>
    <p>“Good Morning, XX. The time is now 6:00 AM, Pacific Standard Time.”</p>
    <p>“Argh… alright, open the curtains.”</p>

    <p><strong>6:10 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      My eyes still bleary, I walk over to the bathroom. I move my hand in front of the faucet to get the water going, and look up at the mirror. You could see the capillaries bursting in my eyes. Sure enough, I didn’t get a good night’s sleep again. I tap the mirror twice to adjust its lighting, and tap once more to open its app menu. I click on Spotify and play shuffle on my favorite morning jazz lo-fi playlist. It was a playlist composed entirely of songs created by human artists and musicians, which was becoming increasingly difficult to find, especially within this genre of music.

    <p><strong>6:40 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      I walk over to the kitchen, ready to make breakfast and begin the day. To start, I ask Alexa to turn on my SmartStove™ and set the heat to medium, perfect for some scrambled eggs and toast. Moving over to the fridge, I swipe up on its touchscreen and select the news app, and I listen to the morning news while cooking.

    <p><strong>8:00 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      Ah, the once dreaded morning commute. But luckily, after my promotion at work, I was able to put my bonus to good use in buying a new car — one with the latest self-driving features. Now, I can sit back and relax during the hour it takes me to get to the office. Or so I hoped, but a promotion entails more money and also more work. Which means I have to sit and reply to my daily emails during my commute.
    </p>

    <p><strong>9:15 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      I walk in through the automatic doors of my office building, hastily walking through the identification scanner so I don’t waste another minute. I was already 15 minutes late, thanks to the never-ending traffic on the freeway. I walk over to the elevators and press the button to go up. I turned to smile at my coworker standing next to me, but they did not seem to see me. I was momentarily confused before realizing that he was wearing the latest SmartGlasses™...
    </p>

    <p><strong>11:00 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      I get up from my cubicle to go stretch, and perhaps visit the cafeteria for an energy-boosting snack...
    </p>

    <p><strong>5:00 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      Clock out time. It’s winter, so by the time I exited the building, the world was dark again...
    </p>

    <p><strong>6:35 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      The traffic during the commute back was worse than expected due to a roadside accident...
    </p>

    <p><strong>8:00 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      After an emergency meeting for work with our overseas team...
    </p>

    <p><strong>10:00 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      After scrolling through my reels for quite some time...
    </p>

    <p><strong>11:50 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      Another day in my life has been completed, yet why do I feel so empty?
    </p>

    <p>
      “Alexa. Are you there?”<br>
      “Yes, what can I help you with?”<br>
      “Close the curtains, please.”
    </p>

    <p>I suppose that’ll have to do for now.</p>
