    <h1>A Day in My Life</h1>

    <p><strong>6:00 AM</strong></p>
    <p>“Alexa… what time is it?”</p>
    <p>“Good Morning, XX. The time is now 6:00 AM, Pacific Standard Time.”</p>
    <p>“Argh… alright, open the curtains.”</p>

    <p><strong>6:10 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      My eyes still bleary, I walk over to the bathroom. I move my hand in front of the faucet to get the water going, and look up at the mirror. You could see the capillaries bursting in my eyes. Sure enough, I didn’t get a good night’s sleep again. I tap the mirror twice to adjust its lighting, and tap once more to open its app menu. I click on Spotify and play shuffle on my favorite morning jazz lo-fi playlist. It was a playlist composed entirely of songs created by human artists and musicians, which was becoming increasingly difficult to find, especially within this genre of music.

    <p><strong>6:40 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      I walk over to the kitchen, ready to make breakfast and begin the day. To start, I ask Alexa to turn on my SmartStove™ and set the heat to medium, perfect for some scrambled eggs and toast. Moving over to the fridge, I swipe up on its touchscreen and select the news app, and I listen to the morning news while cooking.
    </p>

    <p><strong>8:00 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      Ah, the once dreaded morning commute. But luckily, after my promotion at work, I was able to put my bonus to good use in buying a new car — one with the latest self-driving features. Now, I can sit back and relax during the hour it takes me to get to the office. Or so I hoped, but a promotion entails more money and also more work. Which means I have to sit and reply to my daily emails during my commute.
    </p>

    <p><strong>9:15 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
     I walk in through the automatic doors of my office building, hastily walking through the identification scanner so I don’t waste another minute. I was already 15 minutes late, thanks to the never-ending traffic on the freeway. I walk over to the elevators and press the button to go up. I turned to smile at my coworker standing next to me, but they did not seem to see me. I was momentarily confused before realizing that he was wearing the latest SmartGlasses™, and was presumably scrolling through emails, social media, or even watching the ongoing football game. Wonderful, isn’t it? What a way to optimize your time. Even a moment waiting for the elevator goes unwasted; filled with any entertainment or work of choice, all completely done using eye movements. A truly fascinating piece of technology, and one that I’m making a mental note of to get with my next bonus.
    </p>

    <p><strong>11:00 AM</strong></p>
    <p>
      I get up from my cubicle to go stretch, and perhaps visit the cafeteria for an energy-boosting snack. I go down the elevator and enter the cafeteria on the first floor. The entire cafeteria has been recently upgraded to be fully automized, a feature that the company touts proudly as a work benefit. I selected my favorite tomato mozzarella sandwich from the vending machine system, which is not too dissimilar to the interfaces from my own kitchen. Nowadays, all major tech systems have a standardized user interface, making the user experience seamless, and as frictionless as possible.
    </p>

    <p><strong>5:00 PM</strong></p>
    <p>Clock out time.</p>
    <p> 
It’s winter, so by the time I exited the building, the world was dark again. I sit in my car, feeling mentally drained, and set the route back home. Refusing to check my inbox until I reach home, and attempting to maintain some semblance of a work-life balance, I turn on the mini-tv screen in the car. I selected an episode of my favorite show, Friends, during the commute back. Watching it, I realize I haven't really interacted with anyone else in quite a while.
    </p>

    <p>I make a mental note to call some of my own friends when I reach home.</p>
    <p><strong>6:35 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
    The traffic during the commute back was worse than expected due to a roadside accident. Apparently, it was due to a human driver collision. If only everyone else could afford self-driving cars, then maybe things would be better, I wondered.
    </p>

    <p><strong>8:00 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
    After an emergency meeting for work with our overseas team (a problem involving our main data center), I finally unwind and lie down on my bed. In the back of my mind, I remember that I was going to do something once I reached home, but I couldn’t recall what. I open my smartphone and begin scrolling through the notifications on it. Some from work, some old text messages from subscription services I forgot to cancel, some spam messages. Their colorful lights become a blinding blur.

    </p>

    <p><strong>10:00 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      After scrolling through my reels for quite some time, I came across one about the show “Friends”. Then I remembered. I wanted to talk to some of my own friends, as it had been a while. I swipe and go to the phone app, and click on one of their names. The phone rings, and I grow impatient. It got sent to their automated voicemail inbox. I click on another friend’s, and the same thing happens. Frustrated, I go back to scrolling.
    </p>

    <p><strong>11:50 PM</strong></p>
    <p>
      Another day in my life has been completed, yet why do I feel so empty? 

I did my work faithfully, and I optimized every moment of my day to get the maximum level of productivity and contentment out of it. Yet I feel isolated. Who was there to witness my work? Who can I explain my life to? How long has it been since I heard someone else’s voice?

    </p>

    <p>
      “Alexa. Are you there?”<br>
      “Yes, what can I help you with?”<br>
      “Close the curtains, please.”
    </p>

    <p>I suppose that’ll have to do for now.</p>
